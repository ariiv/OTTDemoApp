A React Native app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) that showcases a simple React Native streaming app, designed for **Android TV**.  
It features a home screen, details screen, video player, and a few sample unit + integration tests with Jest.
The app was created under a limited timeframe, so some known limitations and TODOs remain.

Currently:

* Based on community discussions, this appears to be a React Native + Jest config issue. In the given timeframe, I couldn't find solution to this problem.
